  User Stories:
  As a game user I want to be able to play by myself so that I dont need to worry about a computer.
  As a game user I want to be able to Log in with my own account so the app knows its me.
  As a game user I want to be able to have a secure account for keeping my data safe.
  As a game suer I want to play a game that is visually appealing so that I want to keep playing.
  
Problem solving:
   I broke up the main work into four problems:
     Authentication API
     HTML/CSS build
     Game Logic
     Game API
   Within each section I went about this project one small problem at a time. 
   Once I had a working game I made tweaks to make it run a little smoother. 
   I then went and make it look a bit more visually appealing.

For this project, we were given certain requirements:
  
 Make requests interacting with the Authentication API and the Game API:
   Create an account.
   Be able to sign in with created account.
   Have the option to change the password.
   Be able to sign out. 
   Create new games on the server. 
   Update a game by storing new moves.
   Visually display the results of retrieving game statistics.
 
 Technical Specs: 
   Use a custom game engine written by you.
   Be a single-page application, no browser refresh.
   Render a game board in the browser.
   Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select).
   Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw if neither wins.
   Support playing multiple games, one at a time.
   Use jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling.
   Use AJAX for interacting with a provided API.
 
Future Iterations:
  Option to change the gameboard background.
  Display wins and losses. 
  Color scheme update. 
  Navbar login converted to a popup modal. 

Current bugs:
  All solved for the time being.
